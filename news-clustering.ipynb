succumbed to injuries while undergoing treatment at the hospital  The passengers belonged to the East and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh \nThe bus  owned by private operator Yatra Genie  commenced its journey from Hyderabad at 11 30 p m  on Sunday  Khammam Superintendent of Police Shah Nawaz Khan was quoted by the Hindustan Times as saying \nThe accident happened around 2 30 a m  when the driver slammed the brakes to avoid a collision with another vehicle coming from the opposite direction on a bridge over Nagarjunsagar project left canal at Nayankangudem village in Khammam district  the daily reported  The bus hit the parapet wall of the bridge and nose-dived into the canal \nThe driver of the bus was apparently driving at high speed due to which he lost control of the

told the Times of India \nThe actress came to limelight with a show titled  Tujhse Naraz Nahi Zindagi  and had done a number of commercials  She plays the character of Navya  which has a negative

layoffs  says only underperformers asked to leave\nThe United States and South Korea began a joint military drill on Monday  which prompted threats from North Korea  The latter has lately received strong criticism worldwide for defying sanctions from the United Nations Security Council  UNSC  by launching several ballistic missiles  Such actions have led to tighter sanctions for North Korea by the UN \nNorth Korea considers the joint military drill as preparation for invasion  and has threatened a pre-emptive nuclear strike if the U S  and South Korea continue the operation  It had also conducted a nuclear test in January  which further isolated it \n\n\nThe Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercise will continue till Sept  2 and around 25 000 U S  troops are expected to join it  The US-led UN Command Military Armistice Commission said that it had notified the North Korean army that the joint military drill between the two nations was not provocative \n From this moment  the first-strike combined units of the Korean People s Army keep themselves fully ready to mount a preemptive retaliatory strike at all enemy attack groups involved in Ulji Freedom Guardian   a KPA spokesman said in a statement \nIt was recently announced by South Korea that the North s deputy ambassador in London had defected and arrived in Seoul along with his family  The move dealt a blow to Kim Jong Un  the

exploring options to sell it to another lender  Infosys  along with IBM  had won a project in September 2013 to develop computer systems for W G for an estimated Rs  2 500 crore \n\n\n Infosys has been a W G program technology partner for Consulting  Application Delivery and Testing services  and subsequent to this decision  will carry out an orderly ramp-down of about 3 000 persons  primarily in India  over the next few months   the Bengaluru-based IT software services exporter said in a statement last Saturday  August 13  \n The Royal Bank of Scotland announced last week that it will no longer pursue its plan to separate and list a new UK standalone bank  Williams   Glyn  W G   and instead will pursue other options for the divestment of this business  RBS is a key relationship for Infosys and the company looks forward to further strengthening our strategic partnership and working with them across other strategic and transformation programs   Infosys added \nInfosys shares closed at Rs  1 063 30 apiece  down 1 28 percent  on Friday on the Bombay Stock Exchange \nThe company s first quarter  Q1  results were perceived as disappointing by analysts and investors and its decision to scale down the revenue guidance for the current fiscal sent the share crashing almost 10 percent on the day \nInfosys lowered its FY2017 revenue guidance to 10 5-12 percent from 11 5-13 5 percent earlier  After the company announced its guidance on July 15  the Infosys stock fell to Rs  1 060  a loss of 9 78 percent from its previous closing \nThe company s June 2016 quarter

 has continued to do decent business  while the collection of  Aranmanai 2  has completely slowed down in the capital city of Tamil Nadu \n Jil Jung Juk  has earned Rs 74 09 lakh from 165 shows in Chennai  reports Behindwoods  It is considered to be a good opening for the Siddharth starrer  But the Tamil film has garnered mixed response and the success of the flick remains on how it will perform in the coming days \n\n\nMadhavan starrer  Irudhi Suttru  continues to do well in Chennai  In its third weekend  the film raked in Rs 34 78 lakh from 111 shows to take its total tally to Rs 2 70 crore  It collected Rs 67 19 lakh and Rs 59 95 lakh  respectively  in its first and second weekends \nHollywood movie  Deadpool  has got a flying start at the Chennai box office as it has earned Rs 33 92 lakh from 96 shows in the first weekend  It is said to be a good number for an English flick \nVetrimaaran s critically-acclaimed movie  Visaranai  has made decent collection in its second weekend  The Tamil movie has raked in Rs 27 81 lakh from 99 shows in Chennai  In the opening weekend  the movie made Rs 38 88 lakh from 153 shows \nDespite good promotions  latest release  Anjala  got

Rs 2 85 crore  which could be probably broken by Madhavan starrer  Irudhi Suttru  in the coming days \nAnother new release  Vil Ambu  failed to attract the audience as the film raked in Rs 6 75 lakh from 54 shows  Previous week s release  Bangalore Naatkal  has not lived up to the expectations as it earned Rs 3 61 lakh to take its total to Rs 83 30 lakh in Chennai \nPongal release  Rajini Murugan

Suttru  is holding well in the US  while latest release  Visaranai  has performed well  But the collection of  Aranmanai 2  did not see any growth in its second weekend in this centre \nAs per Bollywood Hungama   Irudhi Suttru  was reduced to 23 from 35 screens in its second weekend  It has earned close to Rs 17 lakh to take its total collection to Rs 84 09 lakh  The movie had collected Rs 56 98 lakh by the end of its first weekend \n\n\nVetrimaaran s critically-acclaimed  Visaranai  enjoyed good viewership in the US as the film has earned Rs 15 84 lakh from 14 screens  The film does not have an A-list actor in the cast  yet the flick successfully pulled the audience to the theatres \nNew release  Bangalore Naatkal  was released in 30 screens in the US from which it could only earn Rs 7 94 lakh  However   Aranmanai 2   which has done good business at the domestic box office  failed to attract the audience  The total collection of the Tamil film stands at Rs 10 82 lakh in the US \nIn the UK box office   Aranmanai 2  has performed better than  Irudhi Suttru   While Sundar C s horror film has made a collection of Rs 23 72 lakh  Sudha Kongara Prasad s sport-drama has raked in Rs 19 93 lakh   Bangalore Naatkal  has earned Rs 4 94 lakh from this centre \n Aranmanai 2  is ahead of  Irudhi Suttru  in the Australian box office too  While Siddharth starrer has raked in Rs 19 02 lakh  Madhavan s flick has collected Rs 16 96 lakh \nHowever   Aranmanai 2  has come out with flying colours in Malaysia  where it has done a business of Rs 2 1 crore  It has beaten the record of  Rajini Murugan   which has raked in Rs 1 61 crore till date \n\nCluster 3:\n\nSamsung s 2014 series smartphone Galaxy S4 received the Android Lollipop update in January 2015 and that was
